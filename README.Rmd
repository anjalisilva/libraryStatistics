## Description
`libraryStatistics` is an R package and a Shiny dashboard that permit to visualize, track trends, and compare up to five years of data from the annual survey of Association of Research Libraries (ARL). ARL data describes the collections, staffing, expenditures, and service activities of the ARL member libraries in the United States and Canada.


## Installation

To install the latest version of the package:

``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("anjalisilva/libraryStatistics", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("libraryStatistics")
```

To run the Shiny app:
``` r
libraryStatistics::shinyLibStats()
```


## Overview

To list all functions available in the package: 

``` r
ls("package:libraryStatistics")
```

`libraryStatistics` contains 10 functions. 

1. __*shinyLibStats*__ opens Shiny application which help perform visual analytics of upto to five years of data from the annual survey of ARL uploaded by the user.
2. __*visSummaryAllData*__ visualize sample sizes on institutes submitting data to ARL by year, for the entire dataset uploaded by the user. 
3. __*visTitlesData*__ visualize title statistics using multiple plot types based on user choices.
4. __*visVolumeData*__ visualize volume statistics using multiple plot types based on user choices.
5. __*viseBookData*__ visualize eBook statistics using multiple plot types based on user choices.
6. __*visTotalLibraryExp*__ visualize total library expenditures in United States Dollars (USD) using multiple plot types based on user choices.
7. __*visLibrarySalaries*__ visualize total library salaries in United States Dollars (USD) using multiple plot types based on user choices.
8. __*visStaffCounts*__ visualize library staff counts, full time equivalent (FTE) using multiple plot types based on user choices.
9. __*visPresentationData*__ visualize the number of presentations and participants attending over the years using multiple plot types based on user choices.
10. __*visArticleReqData*__ visualize the number of successful full-text article requests (journals) requests using multiple plot types based on user choices.

## Details

The R package and Shiny dashboard that permit to visualize, track trends, and compare up to five years of data downloaded directly from ARL data portal, with no data cleaning involved. Upon uploading of data, the user is directed to select an institute of choice and up to five years of choice. The user can then see the summary of dataset by each year, and visually compare the selected institute against other libraries for indicators defined by ARL. Additionally, useful ratios and percentages, such as library expenditures per faculty, per student, and per doctoral degree awarded, can be visualized and compared.

Overall, the tool enhances the utilization of ARL collected data in making evidence-based decisions within UTL and other libraries, to gain insights into the multifaceted ways in which library resources contribute to its community, to support research and scholarship endeavors. To the best of our knowledge, no similar work has been done in open-source framework to date. I am interested in submitting this work to be presented as an oral presentation at the useR!2024 conference to take place in Salzburg, Austria in July 2024. The useR! is the most recognized, international conference dedicated to open-source statistical software development using R. The useR! 2022 conference had 1,227 participants from 96 countries. My work will fall under the category of ‘open-source software development for understanding/analytics of library statistics’

## Shiny App

The Shiny app employing __*libraryStatistics*__ could be run and results could be visualized:
``` r
libraryStatistics::shinyLibStats()
```

In simple, the __*shinyLibStats*__ is a web applications available with `libraryStatistics`.
